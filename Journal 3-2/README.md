# 3-2 - Moarrr Digital Ins and Outs

For my digital ins and outs project, I decided to mess with the AND and XOR operators. I made one of the LEDs turn on only if one switch was on, and I made the other LED turn on if both switches were on. If both switches are off, then neither LED is on.

The only thing I got stuck on was figuring out how to implement an XOR operator in my code. I did some research and found out you could just use the bitwise XOR operator (^) to compare two conditional statements.

One Switch On:

Two Switches On:

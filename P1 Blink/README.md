# Project 1 - Blink

For my first project (Blink), I decided to create an interaction between two LEDs, a pontentiometer, and a switch. My idea was to have the potentiometer control how fast the LEDs flash, with the switch determining whether one of the two LEDs was active or not. One LED would flash, and the other would flash in the opposite voltage from the first LED.

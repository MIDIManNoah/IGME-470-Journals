# The Game
This game is a duel- whoever gets hit with a sponge first is defeated. The sponges are launched by modified toasters. They are modified because the timer functions inside are controlled by staplers. When someone connects the metal parts of a stapler by pushing it down, it sends a signal to the toaster. The timer is set to however long the stapler is held down and the connection is made.

# The Rules
Players load two sponges into their toasters and point them at each other.
When the game begins, both players trigger the staplers at the same time. They should do this behind their backs so the other player cannot see.
Players can hold the stapler connection for as much or as little time as they want.
Players may also duck once, for one second or less. Otherwise they cannot move and must face each other.
Eventually the sponges will fly, and the player hit by the fewest sponges wins!

# Project 3 - Squawk

For my third and final project (Squawk), I decided to create three different melodies played back on a simple speaker that are controlled by paperclip-based switches. The notes of the melodies are displayed on a piano in a Unity app.

My experience goal is to let users mix and match melodies and see them displayed in the app.

The loose wires represent alligator clips with paperclips attached on the end. The one attached to ground transmits power, while the other three act as inputs for the power connection.

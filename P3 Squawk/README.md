# Project 3 - Squawk

For my third and final project (Squawk), I decided to create three different melodies played back on a simple speaker that are controlled by paperclip-based switches. The notes of the melodies are displayed on a piano in a Unity app.

My experience goal is to let users mix and match melodies and see them displayed in the app.

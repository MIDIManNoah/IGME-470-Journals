# Project 2 - Move

For my second project (Move), I decided to create a simple Unity app controlled by an Arduino board using a distance sensor as an input and a servo motor as an output. 

My experience goal is to provide users with a simple and fun app to kill time with (change the wording?).

# Development Process

First, I created a project in Unity with a scene that included a rectangular surface, a boxing glove made up of a sphere and a cylinder, and a bunch of cubes stacked on top of the surface. I originally made code that moved the glove with the arrow keys to test the "punching" mechanic. I ran into an issue where the glove could go through the stack of cubes without them reacting until I got to a specific position in the map.

Next, I started programming a distance check for the Arduino using the HC-SR04 sensor as an input. I borrowed most of the code from an example in class (linked to in the References section below).

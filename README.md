# 1-1 - PComp Art

"Which is Your Brass Voice?" is a digital interactive art installation that takes a person's voice and outputs it as musical notes played on a digital brass instrument. It was created by Claudio Benghi and Gloria Ronchi for the International Brass Festival at Durham, UK in 2012. It was also made in celebration of Durham's musical culture.

The experience involved five microphones, each representing a different brass instrument: Trumpet, Trombone, Tuba, Muted Trumpet, and French Horn. The sounds picked up by the microphones are processed and turned into a new composition to be played back by one of the five brass instruments. These sounds are also outputted via colored LED lights to give visual feedback to the audience.

The art installation is made up of several components behind the scenes. Each microphone is routed to a frequency analyzer that converts the input into MIDI notes. These notes are then passed through to computer software that takes the notes and uses AI to generate the music "determining duration, frequency and velocity of a note at a time". An Arduino controls the colored LED lights.
